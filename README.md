# To-Do List App

## Overview

The To-Do List App is a simple Python application built with Tkinter that provides a graphical user interface for managing a to-do list. Users can easily add and remove tasks, and the application persists the list to a file (`list.txt`) for data persistence between sessions.

## Features

- **Add and Remove Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to the to-do list or remove existing ones through a user-friendly interface.
  
- **Persistence:** The application saves the current to-do list to a file (`list.txt`) for data persistence between sessions.
